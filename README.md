### Smart Food Management System 

OVERVIEW:  
A smart food management system integrate technology to optimize food storage, inventory,and consumption.
it uses sofware to monitor food quality
track experiration dates and manage stock level.by providing real time data ,
it helps reduce food waste improve food safety and stream line
supply chain operation this system also include features like waste tracking, 
enhanching efficiency and sustainabilty in both house hold and
commercial kitchens.
Technical Stack:  

- Languages: C++, Java  
- Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
- Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques  

Impact:  

A Smart Food Management System (SFMS) significantly reduces food waste, optimizes inventory, 
and enhances food sustainability. By leveraging IoT, AI, and data analytics, it improves food tracking,
minimizes spoilage, and promotes efficient consumption. SFMS helps users and businesses save costs by managing 
expiration dates, automating reordering, and suggesting meals based on available ingredients. Additionally,
it promotes healthier eating habits and reduces environmental impacts by curbing overproduction and waste. 
Overall, SFMS fosters more efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective food practices across households,
restaurants, and supply chains.
